To compile the assignment you need to first go to the directory which holds the file in your terminal.
You need to come up with a temporary name for the compiled file. In this example we use 'temp'.
In the terminal, you then write: gcc -pthread -o temp main.c.
Next you write ./temp, and the program will then execute.
